        <h1>About This Project</h1>

        <p>
            This web application, the <strong>Arduino-Based GSM Notification System</strong>, was developed as a special project in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master's degree in Engineering at the Technological University of the Philippines. As part of the Industry Immersion Program, this project allowed me, Engr. Neil Aldrin R. Lolinco, to bridge academic knowledge with real-world application, focusing on solving communication challenges faced by service-oriented companies.
        </p>

        <p>
            The system was created specifically for Columbia Technologies, Inc., a premier service provider for internationally recognized brands. Traditionally, the helpdesk team relied heavily on manual phone calls to update clients about their repair statusesâ€”a process prone to delays and inefficiencies due to clients often ignoring unfamiliar numbers. This project addresses that challenge by automating client updates via SMS through an Arduino and GSM module, managed through an easy-to-use web interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ultimately, this web app aims to streamline service center operations, reduce helpdesk workload, and enhance client satisfaction through timely, non-intrusive communication. It demonstrates how simple, cost-effective technologies can significantly impact business workflows, while also serving as a capstone experience that highlights both technical competency and real-world problem-solving skills.
